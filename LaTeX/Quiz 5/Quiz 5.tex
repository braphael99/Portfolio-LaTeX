 \begin{itemize}
	\item You may either type your work using this template, or you may handwrite your work and embed it as an image in this template. \textbf{If you choose to handwrite your work, the image must be legible, and oriented so that we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.} We have included some helpful LaTeX commands for including and rotating images commented out near the end of the LaTeX template.
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.

\begin{required} 
Consider the interval scheduling problem from class. You are given a set of intervals $\mathcal{I}$, where each interval has a start and finish time $[s_i, f_i]$. Your goal is to select a subset $S$ of the given intervals such that (i) no two intervals in $S$ overlap, and (ii) $S$ contains as many intervals as possible subject to condition (i). 

Suppose we have two intervals with the same start time but different finish times. That is, let $I_{1} = [s, f_{1}]$ and $I_{2} = [s, f_{2}]$ with $f_{2} > f_{1}$. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $\text{overlap}([s, f])$ denote the number of intervals of $\mathcal{I}$ (other than $[s, f]$) with which $[s, f]$ overlaps. Explain carefully why $\text{overlap}(I_{1}) \leq \text{overlap}(I_{2})$.
\begin{proof}[Answer]
$\text{overlap}(I_{1})$ has, by definition, less time in it's interval to overlap (as $f_{2} > f_{1}$).\\
So with this information, we know that $I_{2} > I_{1}$, so $\text{overlap}(I_{1})$ would be less than or equal to $\text{overlap}(I_{2})$ since there is less interval of $I_1$ to overlap with.\\
\end{proof}


\vskip 50pt
\item Suppose that $\text{overlap}(I_{1}) < \text{overlap}(I_{2})$. Suppose $S \subseteq \mathcal{I}$ is a non-overlapping set of intervals containing $I_2$. Explain carefully why $(S \backslash \{I_2\}) \cup \{I_1\}$ is another set of non-overlapping intervals, no smaller than $S$.
\begin{proof}[Answer]
We know that $S \subseteq \mathcal{I}$ contains $I_2$.\\
We also know that $\text{overlap}(I_{1}) < \text{overlap}(I_{2})$.\\
Since set $S$ is a non-overlapping set, and the overlap of $I_1$ is less than that of $I_2$, when we union the two sets, there are less overlaps, meaning more intervals that can be added without overlap. This means that $(S \backslash \{I_2\}) \cup \{I_1\}$ is no smaller than $S$, even with the exclusion of $I_2$.\\
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{required}
