\section{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item The solutions \textbf{should be typed}, using proper mathematical notation. We cannot accept hand-written solutions. \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{Here's a short intro to \LaTeX.}
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only (linked from Canvas). Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with your classmates, as well as consult outside resources. You must \textbf{cite your sources in this document.} \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}


\section{Honor Code (Make Sure to Virtually Sign)} \label{HonorCode}

\begin{itemize}
\item My submission is in my own words and reflects my understanding of the material.
\item Any collaborations and external sources have been clearly cited in this document.
\item I have not posted to external services including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc.
\item I have neither copied nor provided others solutions they can copy.
\end{itemize}

%\noindent In the specified region below, clearly indicate that you have upheld the Honor Code. Then type your name. 

\begin{proof}[Agreed (I agree to the above, Blake Raphael).]
%% Typing "I agree to the above," followed by your name is sufficient.
\end{proof}

\section{Standard 31: Structure and Consequences of \textsf{P} vs. \textsf{NP}}
\subsection{Problem \ref{NP1} (4 Points)}
\begin{required} \label{NP1}
A student has a decision problem $L$ which they know is in the class \textsf{NP}. This student wishes to show that L is \textsf{NP}-complete. They attempt to do so by constructing a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to \textsf{SAT}, a known \textsf{NP}-complete problem. That is, the student attempts to show that $L \leq_{p} \textsf{SAT}.$ Determine if this studentâ€™s approach is
correct and justify your answer.

\end{required}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
The student's approach is incorrect because they are trying to show that $L \leq_{p} \textsf{SAT}$. Since $L$ is in class $\textsf{NP}$, they must show that $L$ is $\textsf{NP}$ Hard. If they want to construct a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to $\textsf{SAT}$, they must instead show $\textsf{SAT} \leq_{p} L$. So they must switch their terms to be $\textsf{SAT} \leq_{p} L$.\\

\end{proof}
