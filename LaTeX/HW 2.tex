\section{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item The solutions \textbf{should be typed}, using proper mathematical notation. We cannot accept hand-written solutions. \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{Here's a short intro to \LaTeX.}
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only (linked from Canvas). Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with your classmates, as well as consult outside resources. You must \textbf{cite your sources in this document.} \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}


\section{Honor Code (Make Sure to Virtually Sign)} \label{HonorCode}

%\begin{required}
\begin{itemize}
\item My submission is in my own words and reflects my understanding of the material.
\item Any collaborations and external sources have been clearly cited in this document.
\item I have not posted to external services including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc.
\item I have neither copied nor provided others solutions they can copy.
\end{itemize}

%\noindent In the specified region below, clearly indicate that you have upheld the Honor Code. Then type your name. 
%\end{required}

\begin{proof}[Agreed (signature here).]
%% Typing "I agree to the above," followed by your name is sufficient.
\end{proof}

\section{Standard 2- BFS and DFS}
\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS1} (1.5 points)}
\begin{required} \label{DFS1}
Consider the $\textsf{Connectivity}$ problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsf{Instance:} Let $G(V, E)$ be a simple, undirected graph. Let $s, t \in V(G)$.
\item \textsf{Decision:} Is there a path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$?
\end{itemize}

\noindent \\ Do the following. [\textbf{Note:} There are parts (a) and (b). Part (b) is on the next page.]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Design an algorithm to solve the $\textsf{Connectivity}$ problem. Your solution should provide enough detail that a CSCI 2270 student could reasonably be expected to implement your solution.
\begin{proof}[Answer for Part (a)]
%Your answer goes here
\end{proof}



\newpage
\item We say that the graph $G$ is \textit{connected} if for every pair of vertices $s, t \in V(G)$, there exists a path from $s$ to $t$. Design an algorithm to determine whether $G$ is connected. Your algorithm should only traverse the graph once- this means that you should \textbf{not} apply BFS or DFS more than once. Your solution should provide enough detail that a CSCI 2270 student could reasonably be expected to implement your solution.

\begin{proof}[Answer for Part (b)]
%Your answer goes here
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{required}






\newpage
\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS2} (1 point)} 
\begin{required} \label{DFS2}
Give an example of a simple, undirected, and unweighted graph $G(V, E)$ that has a single source shortest path tree which a \textbf{depth-first traversal} will not return for any ordering of its vertices. 
    Your answer must
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    	\item Provide a drawing of the graph $G$. [\textbf{Note:} We have provided TikZ code below if you wish to use \LaTeX \ to draw the graph. Alternatively, you may hand-draw $G$ and embed it as an image below, provided that (i) your drawing is legible and (ii) we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.]
    	\item Specify the single source shortest path tree $T = (V,E_T)$ by specifying $E_T$ and also specifying the root $s \in V$. [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 
    	\item Include a clear explanation of why the depth-first search algorithm we discussed in class will never produce $T$ for any orderings of the vertices.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{required}

\noindent 
\begin{proof}[Answer]
%Your proof goes here.
\end{proof}


\noindent The following provides a sample of how to draw graphs with \LaTeX. You may use the graph below, or you may come up with your own example.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[
		wide/.style={line width=4pt},
		every node/.style={circle,draw,minimum size=16},
		scale=2]
		\node (s) at (-0.5,0)            {$s$};
		\node (u) at ($ (0,0) + ( 60:1)$) {$u$};
		\node (v) at ($ (0,0) + (-60:1)$) {$v$};
		\node (w) at ($ (u) + ( 1.5,0 )$) {$w$};
		\node (x) at ($ (v) + ( 1.5,0 )$) {$x$};
		\node (t) at ($ (w) + (-60:1) + (0.5,0)$) {$t$};
		\draw (s) -- (u);
		\draw (u) -- (w);
		\draw (w) -- (t);

% Replace the line \draw (w) -- (t); with the line below (after deleting the % symbol to uncomment) in order to draw a thicker edge.
%		\draw[line width=3pt] (w) -- (t);


		\draw (s) -- (v);
		\draw (v) -- (x);
		\draw (x) -- (t);
		\draw (u) -- (x);    
		\draw (v) -- (w);
		
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}







\newpage
\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS4} (1.5 points)}
\begin{required} \label{DFS4}
	Give an example of a simple, undirected, weighted graph such that a breadth-first traversal outputs a search-tree that is not a single source shortest path tree. (That is, BFS is not sufficiently powerful to solve the shortest-path problem on weighted graphs. This motivates Dijkstra's algorithm, which will be discussed in the near future.) 
	Your answer must
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Draw the graph $G = (V,E, w)$ by specifying $V$ and $E$, clearly labeling the edge weights.  [\textbf{Note:} We have provided TikZ code below if you wish to use \LaTeX \ to draw the graph. Alternatively, you may hand-draw $G$ and embed it as an image below, provided that (i) your drawing is legible and (ii) we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.]
		\item Specify a spanning tree $T(V, E_{T})$ that is returned by BFS, but is not a single-source shortest path tree. [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 

		\item Specify a valid single-source shortest path tree $T^{\prime} = (V,E_{T^{\prime}})$.  [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 

		\item Include a clear explanation of why the search-tree output by breadth-first search is not a valid single-source shortest path tree of $G$.
	\end{enumerate}

		\draw (v) edge[bend left=25] node[below, draw=none,fill=none]{0} (w);
		\draw (s) -- node[above, draw=none,fill=none]{0} (u);

		\draw (w) -- node[above, draw=none,fill=none]{0} (t);
